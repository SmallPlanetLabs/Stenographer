# Stenographer

## A Logging Utility

Note this is prerelease software subject to robust changes.

### Background

The goal of this package is to provide an easy to use and universal method to log information to the Console via OSLog and using SwiftLog via Pulse.

### Installation

Add Stenographer to your project through Xcode by adding a project with the repository's url.

### Usage

#### Adding Pulse UI

In order to use the prebuilt Pulse Logging view there are 2 steps.

1. Import Pulse UI by adding the following to the `View` that will display the Pulse UI.

```swift
import PulseUI
```

2. Add the `MainView` to your `View`. This can be done however you prefer. For this example we will use a `NavigationLink`.

```swift
NavigationLink("Logs", destination: MainView())
```

#### Adding Custom Log Categories

Adding custom log categories is easy and can be managed via an extension to `Logging.Logger`.

1. Create a `.swift` file to handle your extension code.

2. Import Stenographer and Logging by adding the following to your extension file.

```swift
import Stenographer
import Logging
```

3. Extend `Logging.Logger`.

```swift
extension Logging.Logger {
	// This is were your category code will go
}
```

4. Add your custom categories inside your extension.

```swift
extension Logging.Logger {
	static let analytics = Log(category: "üìà analytics")
	static let bootstrap = Log(category: "ü•æ bootstrapping")
	static let keychain = Log(category: "üîê keychain")
	static let lifecycle = Log(category: "üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è lifecycle")
}
```

#### Logging with your custom categories.

1. Import `Logging` to the file where you want to log.

```swift
import Logging
```

2. Then log with the according log level.

```swift
Logger.bootstrap.info("App initialized")
Logger.analytics.error("Analytics server returned error \(error)")
// etc
```
